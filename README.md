# Plant Disease Detection Robot (PDDR)

## Description

This is a project made by [Lê Cảnh Toàn](https://github.com/LeCaToX), [Phạm Hồ Mạnh Tú](https://github.com/StewAway) and [Đặng Thành Phát](https://github.com/alexeipc) to create a robot that detects potatoes, tomatoes, and pepper diseases based on their leaves' appearance. For the AI model, we use CNN using Tensorflow with the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village. For the robot, we use electric components from Arduino.

## Motivation

As agriculture is the primary industry in Vietnam, we want to use this robot to help farmers detect diseases on plants more efficiently and effectively. 

## Set up

## Free API for potato leaf disease classification
