# Plant Disease Detection Robot (PDDR)

## Description

This is a project made by [Lê Cảnh Toàn](https://github.com/LeCaToX), [Phạm Hồ Mạnh Tú](https://github.com/StewAway) and [Đặng Thành Phát](https://github.com/alexeipc) to create a robot that detects potatoes, tomatoes, and pepper diseases based on their leaves' appearance.

<br>

For the AI model, we have built a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) with the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). For the hardware system, we use electronic components from Arduino. 

## Inspiration

As agriculture is the primary sector of the Vietnamese economy, we want to use this robot and provide free API to help farmers detect diseases on plants more efficiently and effectively and enhance agricultural productivity.  

## Set up

## Free API for leaf disease classification
